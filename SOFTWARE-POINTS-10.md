# **About Project and Branches**
  **PLAYGROUND BOOKING**
The Playground Booking, is a software helps to book various kind of playgrounds for corresponding sports to the people or the organizations. I want to build some codes that is user friendly and help or improvize safety and security to the messages that one can send to others as a confirmation.
>> Method

+ Using Visual studio as IDE and coressponded compliers.
+ Storing every data and update changes will updated in the github.
>> Inside Code
+ Declaring various Function.

# **IDE-Integrated Development Environment**
   + Python Tools for Visual Studio(VS) is a free and open-source plug-in called Python Support in Visual Studio. Working with Python in Visual Studio Code, using the Microsoft Python extension, is simple, fun, and productive. 
   + The extension makes VS Code an excellent Python editor, and works on any operating system with a variety of Python interpreters.
   + It leverages all of VS Code's power to provide auto complete and IntelliSense, linting, debugging, and unit testing, along with the ability to easily switch between Python environments, including virtual and conda environments.
   + follow for more this [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python) about Visual Studio.
