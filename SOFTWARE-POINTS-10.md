# $\textcolor{yellow}{About\ Project\ and\ Branches}$
  **PLAYGROUND BOOKING**
The Playground Booking, is a software helps to book various kind of playgrounds for corresponding sports to the people or the organizations. I want to build some codes that is user friendly and help or improvize safety and security to the messages that one can send to others as a confirmation.
>> Method 
+ Im gonna use Python, for developing the codes and *GUI-Graphic User Interface* in it to look good and user friendly.
+ Using Visual studio as IDE and coressponded compliers.
+ Storing every data and update changes will updated in the github.
>> Inside Code
+ Declaring various Function.
+ Using different Variables.
+ Code will be well structured and processed.



# **UML DIAGRAMS**
>>Activity Diagram
+ Activity diagram in UML describe the dynamic aspects of the system. It is basically flowchart to represent the flow from one activity to another activity.
+ The activity can be described as an operation of the system.

This diagram represents the high-level flow of program, focusing on the main activities and decision points.


>>Component Diagram
+ component diagram depicts how components are wired together to form larger components or software systems.
+ They are used to illustrate the structure of arbitrarily complex systems.

>>Class Diagram
+ class diagram in the Unified Modeling Language is a type of static structure diagram that describes the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes, operations, and the relationships among objects.

>>Use Case Diagram
+ Use-case model provides a formal mechanism for arrying out a requirement analysis with active participation from domain experts and users who may or may not be software savvy.

# **IDE-Integrated Development Environment**
   + Python Tools for Visual Studio(VS) is a free and open-source plug-in called Python Support in Visual Studio. Working with Python in Visual Studio Code, using the Microsoft Python extension, is simple, fun, and productive. 
   + The extension makes VS Code an excellent Python editor, and works on any operating system with a variety of Python interpreters.
   + It leverages all of VS Code's power to provide auto complete and IntelliSense, linting, debugging, and unit testing, along with the ability to easily switch between Python environments, including virtual and conda environments.
   + follow for more this [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python) about Visual Studio.
